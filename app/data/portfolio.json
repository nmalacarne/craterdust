    "description": "2013 was a record-setting year for GLOCK as they successfully shipped over a million pistols from their North American HQ in Smyrna, GA. With the upcoming launch of two new pistol models in January 2014, GLOCK was looking to refresh their advertising campaign creative while still maintaining the “Confidence” messaging they have become synonymous with. CraterDust proposed a new campaign tagline that would leverage the previous years messaging while reaching out to the ever-growing numbers of concealed-carry pistol owners across the country. “Confidence. It’s What You Carry.” speaks to both the literal translation of what one carries on their person as well as to the way people carry themselves. The updated tagline allowed GLOCK to engage consumers on multiple levels and became the basis for the 2014 advertising campaign.",

After a few phone calls, the storyboards below are what was presented to the production company. With few differences, the video reflects a fairly accurate portrayal of the extended cut that can be seen currently on YouTube. The video featured here is the edited version which was created for commercial broadcasts. The ‘Wrong Diner’ is among the highest of GLOCK fan favorites and went on to win multiple Communicator awards the year it debuted.",

We began with thumbnail sketches that explored similar shapes found in the sport of golf. Once we nailed down the sweeping form language, we moved to orthographic views and established material finishes. A foam scale-model was then made that enabled us to check the proportions and view the trophy from multiple angles. After presenting the concept to Crowne Plaza, the model was green-lit and went to custom fabricators for production. Varying thicknesses of brushed aluminum were shaped and cut using CNC water-jets while a custom glass-blown golf ball was created by world famous Chihuly studios. Assembly and finishing were completed with a hand-made, polished maple base. The trophy was prominently displayed at various Crowne Plaza golf events leading up to the culmination of the tournament where it was awarded to the champion.",

Beginning with site surveys to several locations, photos and measurements were taken along with notes leading to a thorough understanding of the clinics’ current layouts and efficiency with regard to administering patient care. Initial plan views offered led to alternative traffic flow solutions that would increase workflow and patient treatment efficiency. With increased functionality and best use of space now solved, the focus then turned to a new lighter interior with updated colors, flooring and furniture. Presentation renderings and swatch boards of several local area hospitals were then presented to the hospital’s Board of Directors. The presentation got Presbyterian staff very excited and the hospital is currently moving forward while discussing planning and funding.",
